# Simple_Neural_Network_Class
This is my first try to create my own neural network class implementation. You can set how many layers you want, the size of each layer, the epochs (loop size), choose between RELU and SIGMOID activation function and also set an alpha value for weight recalculation.

Currently it has no bias value. You can solve simple linear and non linear problems.
